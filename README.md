## <a name="analysis"></a>Analysis/Conclusions
Using Excel, we analyzed Nashville Rock-and-Roll Marathon data from 2016-2019 to explore interesting facts regarding the fastest, slowest, mean, median and quartile data points.  It was interesting to discover how many people each year beat the benchmark of Oprah's marathon run time.  We looked at trends over the four year period and discovered the one year that was so incredibly hot that race times were impacted.   It was an interesting data set to explore!
